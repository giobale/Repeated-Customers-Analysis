    "# **Orders Dataset Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following dataset represents a collection of orders placed over four years, from 2021 to 2024. It is structured to simulate real-world transactional data for analysis. Each field is explained below, along with a practical use case scenario to demonstrate how this data could be collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Dataset Fields Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`order_date`**: \n",
    "  - *Type*: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n",
    "  - *Description*: The exact date when an order was placed. This field captures the transaction timing.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `2021-08-16`\n",
    "  - **Use**: Useful for analysing seasonality in purchases, monthly trends, or specific promotions that influence buying behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`customer_id`**: \n",
    "  - *Type*: String\n",
    "  - *Description*: A unique identifier for each customer. The same customer ID may appear multiple times if they placed orders in different years.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `CUST-0444`\n",
    "  - **Use**: Important for tracking customer purchasing patterns over time, identifying repeat buyers, and segmenting customers based on order history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`user_segment`**: \n",
    "  - *Type*: Categorical (small, medium, large)\n",
    "  - *Description*: The segment to which the customer belongs, based on factors such as spending history, purchasing frequency, or account size.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `large`\n",
    "  - **Use**: Segmentation helps in targeted marketing strategies, understanding customer behavior by group, and offering personalised discounts or promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`product_id`**: \n",
    "  - *Type*: String\n",
    "  - *Description*: A unique identifier for each product in the catalog.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `PROD-183`\n",
    "  - **Use**: This allows product-level analysis to see which items are most popular, measure the performance of specific products, and manage inventory effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`product_segment`**: \n",
    "  - *Type*: Categorical (product-segment-1, product-segment-2, product-segment-3)\n",
    "  - *Description*: The category or type of product purchased. This can represent different product lines, departments, or item classifications.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `product-segment-1`\n",
    "  - **Use**: Used to understand the performance of different product lines, identify key drivers of revenue, and manage cross-category strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`order_year`**: \n",
    "  - *Type*: Integer (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)\n",
    "  - *Description*: The year in which the order was placed.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `2021`\n",
    "  - **Use**: Enables annual analysis to detect year-on-year growth, assess the impact of market changes or events on sales, and forecast future demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`order_value_eur`**: \n",
    "  - *Type*: Float (EUR)\n",
    "  - *Description*: The total value of the order in euros. The value ranges are based on the customer segment, with \"small\" spending between 5 and 200 EUR, \"medium\" between 200 and 500 EUR, and \"large\" between 500 and 1000 EUR.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `937.59 EUR`\n",
    "  - **Use**: Crucial for revenue analysis, profit margins, and customer lifetime value (CLV) calculations. Also useful for understanding pricing sensitivity across different customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example Use Case Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset could represent orders collected by a **B2B SaaS platform** that provides software solutions to businesses of various sizes. These businesses may subscribe to different tiers of software packages or purchase additional services.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- **Small business customers** could be purchasing basic subscription plans, which provide limited features suitable for startups or local operations.\n",
    "- **Medium businesses** might opt for a more robust package that includes analytics, collaboration tools, and integrations with other systems.\n",
    "- **Large enterprises** might purchase premium services such as dedicated customer support, advanced AI-driven features, or bespoke customisation of the platform.\n",
